# Knockri Full Stack (React) Coding Assessment

## Stack Used:
React - Frontend Library for project
Axios - To perform request to api end point
React Router - To allow for client side routing of React components.
BootSwatch - To provide bootstrap theme for proto typing.


## Why i've decided to use the current stack.
I've decided on the technology stack as i felt the size and time constraint of completing the test wouldn't benefit from adding additional module; i.e using the natural state mamnagemnt that comes with react as opposed to to using a state management libray like redux or mobx

## To start the application
1) First run npm run install-api; to install api dependancies
2) Secondly run npm run install-client; to install client side dependancies
3) Finally to run the application, npm run start

## What I would implement if had additional time 
1) utilize an express backend to serve the content and to future proof it for future changes
2) utilize redux for extending the application in the future
